# doctor-dashboard

The main page, contains navbar to move to different section or to login, there are various sections in main page which contain:
1. home page - which has a book appointment button which takes to login page for patient to login
2. about page - which contains information about our doctors
3. Testinomials page - which contains feedback from patient as well doctors.
4. contact page - which contains information to contact to the admin.


In this project, i have created three panels
1. admin's panel
2. Doctor's panel
3. Patient's panel

In admin's panel, i will keep track of patients, complains and doctors.
In doctor's panel, doctor will be able to look for their appointments and can confirm as well.
In patient's panel, patient will be able to book appointment, check status and file complaint as well.

For now, only new patients can register.

So, this is my whole website which i have created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, XAMPP.
